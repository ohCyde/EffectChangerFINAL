The Effect Changer is basically a patch that maps
my HID buttons, my Quanba Obisidian, to different 
effects inside of max. My right analog stick can 
control a filebrowser that allows me to insert a song. 
While the face buttons control different effects 
linked to the SfPlay and BEAP effects. I also routed the left and right analog 

Square- Reverb 1
X- Flanger
Circle- Reverb 2
Triangle- Chorus


Change the mode button to alternate 
between left stick and right stick
Left Stick(Green)- Speed
Right Stick(Red)- Pitch
